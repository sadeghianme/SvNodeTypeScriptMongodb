# Description
This project is a basic structure of backend application developed using Node.js with TypeScript, showcasing a modular architecture that facilitates maintainability and scalability. It leverages MongoDB as the database, with Mongoose for object data modeling, providing a robust and efficient way to handle data interactions. The application implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization, ensuring that API access is protected and user sessions are managed reliably. Additionally, the project incorporates a dedicated logging mechanism, which is crucial for monitoring activities, debugging, and maintaining the overall health of the application. This architecture not only promotes clean and organized code but also demonstrates best practices for building modern, full-featured backend systems.
